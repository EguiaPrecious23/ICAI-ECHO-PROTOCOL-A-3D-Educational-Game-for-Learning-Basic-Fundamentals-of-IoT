ICAI ECHO PROTOCOL: A 3D Educational Game for Learning Basic Fundamentals of IoT Using Arduino Uno Kits
Internet of Things integrated itself on people and technology nowadays. IoT makes the life 
easier and student nowadays prefer nontraditional way of learning. ICAI: Echo Protocol is 
a 3D first - person educational game designed to introduce learners to the basic 
fundamental concept of Internet of Things (IoT) through interactive and gamified learning. 
Developed using Unity and C#, the game allows players to engage in a story – driven 
environment where they complete missions that stimulated Arduino – based applications 
such as servo motor control and basic circuit building. By integrating guided tutorials, 
explorations and practical challenges, the system bridges the gap between theoretical 
learning and hands-on experience, making IoT education more accessible and engaging for 
students. Players gain knowledge and will learn how every basic part of the Arduino 
functions and work. The game’s content coverage only includes basic fundamentals of IoT. 
The game can only be played through desktop and windows operating systems
